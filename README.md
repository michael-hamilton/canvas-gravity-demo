# Canvas Gravity Demo
A simple HTML canvas experiment implementing gravity.

## Setup
Run `npm i` to install dependencies, then run `npm run dev` to start a development server (likely at http://localhost:1234).
Alternatively, `npm build` will bundle everything into `/dist`.

## Usage
* Up/Down arrows change the effect of gravity
* Left/Right arrows change the bounce effect
* Number keys (1-9) changes the number of balls
* Space to reinitialize
